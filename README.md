## Usage and Instructions

For users that need to keep a track of lot of information, at times, it becomes difficult to recall everything. This app will allow the users to log the information and give each set of information, a title, which helps to get to the exact information needed. 

The user can give their note a title, and type in the main text and hit the save button. This will be stored and only the title will be visible to the user. A side bar will show all the titles. Clicking over the titles, will display the entire content of the note. 

The user is also able to delete the notes that they no longer need.

Everytime the user opens the app, the previously saved notes will be available to view.
